## ✅ Problem Format

Each file follows this structure:

```js
/*
🔍 Problem: Find the Second Largest Element in an Array

📄 Description:
Given an array of integers, find the second largest element without sorting.

🧪 Input:  [4, 9, 0, 2, 8, 7, 1]
🎯 Output: 8

💡 Approach:
- Use two variables: largest and secondLargest initialized to -Infinity.
- Traverse the array once to update values accordingly.

⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n)

Imp:

# If we console the function call and function returns nothing then we will get "Undefined" as function is returning nothing.
